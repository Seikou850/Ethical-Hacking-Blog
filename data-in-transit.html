            <h2 id="intro">Data in transit</h2>
            <p>Data in transit is data that we send from one system to another. This includes personal projects, work,
                confidential data, or business. It is very important that when our data is in transit from one system to
                another, it is 100% protected.
                Here below I will leave tips and examples of how to protect the data that is in transit.
            <h2>Implementation of secure key and certificate management</h2>
            </p>
            <p>In a world where there are so many people and automated machines that know how to steal confidential
                data, it is important to be alert, since an encryption that used to protect your data is now no longer
                useful because it has been violated by an algorithm.
                Simple substitution encryption should not be used because this encryption replaces each letter in the
                message with another letter of the alphabet. For example, D would be replaced by A, F, or G, and this
                encryption technique using simple substitution cipher is an easy cipher to break using frequency
                analysis techniques, which what this frequency does is identify the most common letter in the encrypted
                message and what this technique does is assume that it corresponds to the most common letter of the
                alphabet. </p>

            <p> For example, if you use simple substitution encryption for facial data transit, your data will be
                exposed or stolen and if you are a company you can get a big fine due to the GDPR law and if you are a
                person you can end up in jail or with a fine for using an obsolete encryption, and the recommendation
                that I am going to give you is that you use encryption such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), this
                encryption uses a key to encrypt and decrypt the data and uses a block structure to encrypt the data in
                128-bit blocks. AES is highly secure and resistant to known cryptographic attacks, making it widely used
                in applications such as file encryption, disk encryption, and network encryption. </p>

            <p>In addition, to protect the privacy and integrity of data in transit through communication networks, it
                is recommended to use the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol that uses AES encryption and other
                encryption algorithms to protect data. TLS is used by many web applications, such as e-mail and
                e-commerce, and is essential for ensuring the security of online communications.

            <p>To enhance the protection of data during its transfer, it is crucial to utilise secure and updated
                software and hardware. This involves implementing firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems,
                and antivirus software. By regularly updating and patching these systems, the likelihood of
                vulnerabilities and exploits that could endanger data is reduced.</p>
            <p>
                It is also advisable to utilise virtual private networks (VPNs) to encrypt data during transit,
                preventing unauthorised interception and access. VPNs establish a secure and private network connection
                between multiple devices, even over a public network.</p>
